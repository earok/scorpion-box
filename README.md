This is an early work in progress which was originally based on https://github.com/seanocali/Libretro.NET, which implements Libretro in the .NET framework with a MonoGame sample. The project still uses MonoGame but has switched to using the wrapper code from https://github.com/humbertodias/RetroUnityFE. 

The intent is to provide a pipeline for publishing retro games (Particularly Scorpion Engine's target platforms of Amiga/Mega Drive/NeoGeo) on modern platforms such as PC, Android, iOS and consoles.

Essentially - an extremely stripped down single game emulator that facilitates one of Libretro's cores.
